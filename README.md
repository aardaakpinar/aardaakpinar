# Hi ^^ me NAR!
<img align="right" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=devnar&show_icons=true&theme=radical"> 
I am a developer who is always upset and hungry. Im hungry to learning new things, solving math or to eating food (DÃ¶ner will be overpreferred). But even though I'm always sad, sometimes I can be happy, especially when the person I love and care about is next to me.
